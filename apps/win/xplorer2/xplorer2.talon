# Q: Could I also ask about the title bar of the window: could I set it to whatever I want?
# A: There is a registry tweak called DPF_NOTITLE, you can look it up in a file 
# called REGISTRY.TXT in the xplorer2 installation folder, but to turn it on 
# requires registry editing after you quit xplorer2. For more information 
# see REGISTRY.TXT file
